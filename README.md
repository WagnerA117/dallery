A brief introduction before anything technical. 

I have always found that when things get busy in life, I like to sit and write and draw. Lately I've been taking film photos and finding paintings on Pintrest who help give me a moment of pause and peace. 

I wanted to build an application that gave me a place to back up photos I've taken and drawings I've done over the years. I hope that in the future Dallery might become something similar to you too.
