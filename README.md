A brief introduction before anything technical. 

I have always found that when life becomes a little overwhelming, I like to sit somewhere quite and writ or draw. Lately I've been taking film photos and finding paintings on Pintrest who help give me a moment of pause and peace. 

I wanted to build an application that gave me a place to back up photos I've taken and drawings I've done over the years. I hope that in the future Dallery might become something similar to you too. 

I enjoy creating, and would like to learn more how to do this with code. Building this little project is to help me learn more about Firebase, React, TypeScript and React.
